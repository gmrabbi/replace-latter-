it's usually used to encoding and decoding 


alphabet        =    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z                                                                                                
user_alphabet   =    M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L
 
suppose you want to change latter "A" to latter "M" and after that the next latter would chage autometically by it's own sequence.

like "apple" => "mbbxq"  😎

then how can you do that..?🤷‍♂️🤷‍


suppose someone sent you "mjqqt ijfw mtb fwj dtz?" this message. an anonymous user get your message anyhow . can he/she understand easily that actually what it is?
is it "hello dear how are you?" ?????😴😴

In this way we can protect our privacy.❤💖

just not only this, we can also make our message like a reverse/random word.

how can you use it?
first of all open the application.
In message filed type your message ..
Then fillup the starting latter..[ you can take any latter as you want.]
Then submit ..

===="BOOM"====

Now look at this..
This is the encoding process....

Then how you can decode this message..
what you get from your encoding message or someone, just type your message againg at the message entry fill..
Then put the decoding Starting latter..
 
message -------------------- starting latter
"mnja"------------------------- "d"
"dear"--------------------------"m"

i think you have make sence it ..✌✌✌

if you face any problem just info me..🤦‍♂️🤷‍♀️

thank you..💖💖❤❤💕💕
